# Battleships

## Prerequisites:

* NET Core 2.1

## How to run

* Clone this repository

* Open terminal and navigate to the repositories `Battleships` directory

* Run `dotnet run`

## Remarks

I've decided to not use any IoC containers in this task for simplicity, however if I were to use one, I would choose ASP.NET Core Generic Host (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-2.1)
